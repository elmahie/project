            <h3>Area Identified for Improvement</h3>
            <p style="color: black;">
                Communication played a crucial role in our project, as it enabled us to keep each other accountable and stay updated on the progress of various tasks. By understanding what each team member was working on, we could effectively identify remaining tasks and clarify expectations to ensure alignment. Additionally, our willingness to share the workload among team members greatly improved our group's efficiency.</p>
            
            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p style="color: black;">Starting iterations as soon as possible is crucial. It's important to overestimate how difficult and complex features, user stories, and tasks might be. We might want to consider assigning roles like project manager within the team. We could switch this up each time we start a new iteration. This person would be responsible for checking in with everyone on the team regularly to make sure we're staying on track to deliver on time.</p>
            
            <h3>If We Could Start Over</h3>
            <p style="color: black;">Reflecting on our team's development experience, we recognize the need to improve our approach in several areas. Specifically, we should have initiated tasks earlier to provide more flexibility and mitigate last-minute rushes. Additionally, a proactive stance in anticipating obstacles and planning accordingly would have been beneficial. We also acknowledge the importance of fostering a culture of continuous improvement and feedback within the team. By addressing these areas, we can be more effective in our future projects.Report work progress to the team regularly in order to adjust the plan and ensure the project can be completed on time. Adjust the work appropriately based on feedback from team members. It can help improve work quality and efficiency.  </p>
            
            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            <p style="color: black;">Collaborating within a group presents its challenges, but the rewards are significant. Through this experience, we've learned how to communicate more effectively and find creative solutions last minute. It's essential to take into account individuals' skills and interests when delegating tasks. Additionally, anticipating worst-case scenarios and allocating time for unforeseen issues and throughly testing of all components is extremely important to ensure a successful outcome. Ultimately, this project has beeen a significant learning experience for us, helping us gain new skils that will be applied to our future projects </p>
