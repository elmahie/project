                    <h3 >Description:</h3>
                    <p style=" text-align: center;font-size: smaller;color:black">The UM class scheduler system will be used to view classes and plan schedules for a given academic term. It functions by offering students different possible combinations of classes that can be taken in a given semester. This application takes into account classes already taken, the minimum grade required, degree requirements, and student preferences. The system will also maintain a record that can be updated every semester to include the classes taken by the students, providing support during the entirety of their degree.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Users:</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: center;font-size: smaller;color:black">The users of this project will be both incoming and current computer science students, as well as academic advisors. The goal is to assist students in picking their classes while accounting for other commitments and personal preferences. The application can also be used by computer science advisors to advise students about the availability of classes. Students will have access to the system allowing them to enter classes taken and view their respective grades, while advisors will be able to view and validate this information.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Value:</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: center;font-size: smaller;color:black">Our application will be a significant improvement over the current Aurora system. Currently, to register for classes on Aurora, one needs to navigate between multiple pages, often leading to errors as students try to register for classes they’re ineligible for. Our system will tailor the list to only include classes for which a student meets the prerequisites. As a result, students will save the time and effort required to check each course’s description. Additionally, the system will suggest classes that are pertinent to the student’s degree. This, in turn, minimizes the risk of students taking incompatible and unnecessary courses, ensuring a smoother academic journey.</p>
                    
                    <p style="text-align: center;font-size: smaller;color:black">Another improvement is to allow users to specify their availability and plan a course schedule based on this information. Given that many students have other commitments including jobs, volunteering, athletics, and other extracurricular activities, this feature will help simplify the scheduling process. The system will also ensure that students do not take courses that satisfy the same academic requirement. Our app will be initially limited to Computer Science courses at the University of Manitoba, but it can be easily generalized to include other fields of study.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Success Criteria:</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: center;font-size: smaller;color:black">The project will be considered a success based on the following criteria. Firstly, if the system accurately suggests a course load that can be registered for in a given semester, while also considering the student’s preferences. Another metric we’ll use to measure the success of the application is a reduction in the amount of time and steps it takes students to plan a full semester of courses using other tools. The app would also help computer science student advisors suggest classes to students more efficiently, saving them time & effort. Lastly, the application will be successful if it plans the degree such that the degree time is optimized accounting for their preferences.</p>
                    
                    <p style="text-align: center;font-size: smaller;color:black">In essence, the UM class scheduler system seeks to improve the academic planning for Computer Science students at the University of Manitoba by offering an efficient and user-tailored solution.</p>
