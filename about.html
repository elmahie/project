                <h3><strong>Avneet Sidhu</strong></h3>
                <p style="color: black;"><small>Through this project, I gained valuable insights and practical experience in Database Management through this project, enhancing my skills in organizing, manipulating, and retrieving data efficiently.</small></p>
                
                <h3><strong>Eman Elmahi</strong></h3>
                <p style="color: black;"><small>From this project, I gained valuable experience in Git and version control, which will be incredibly beneficial in future projects. I've learned many interesting design principles for front-end development on the app and the website and gained a deeper understanding of making user-friendly interfaces.</small></p>
                
                <h3><strong>Gabriel Barnabé</strong></h3>
                <p style="color: black;"><small>One skill that I found improved dramatically was the ability to debug problems in a project quickly. I now find that finding the source of a bug is more intuitive, and I have gained a better understanding of the tools that help me achieve this goal as well.
                    Another thing I feel I’ve gained is the understanding of the underlying reasons behind structuring things a certain way within code – that working on code given a certain structure may become more difficult later compared to other methods. Getting firsthand experience with this proved a great learning experience, and made structuring software in future projects more intuitive!</small></p>
